            <p>My second virtual work experience was with Fujitsu, where I learned about SOAR, short for 'Security Orchestration Automation & Response.' This technology is essential for tackling cybersecurity issues. Additionally, we explored topics on smart cities and quantum computing.

            <h6>Linux</h6>
            <p>I recently completed the "Linux Unhatched" course, which provided me with a foundational introduction to the Linux operating system. This entry-level course was instrumental in helping me understand basic Linux commands and operations through engaging, hands-on activities. Upon completion, I received a certificate that not only acknowledges my initial mastery of Linux basics but also sets the stage for further professional development in information technology. This certification is a significant first step towards advanced Linux training and other IT opportunities.</p>

            <h6>Vodafone</h6>
            <p>I had my first remote job experience at Vodafone, where I learned to develop new products. Our project involved designing a digital tool aimed at making everyday activities simpler for people. This job really showed me the benefits of using technology to help with daily life.

            <h6>Siemens</h6>
            <p>I also had a work experience with Siemens, where the focus was on using renewable energy to generate electricity. During this placement, I delved into various forms of sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. The program emphasized the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives, providing a deep understanding of the technological and environmental challenges involved. This experience not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also strengthened my commitment to environmental stewardship.
