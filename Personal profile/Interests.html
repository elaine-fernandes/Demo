                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Elaine Fernandes, a tech enthusiast with a passion for cybersecurity and a student at Staffordshire University London, currently studying Level 4 Cyber Security. As someone deeply fascinated by the intersection of technology and security, I've devoted much of my time to learning about cybersecurity principles and best practices. Whether it's understanding the latest encryption techniques or staying updated on emerging cyber threats, I find immense joy in exploring the ever-evolving landscape of digital security.</p>

                    <h3>Interests</h3>
                    <p> In my free time, I sometimes like to explore new things related to my course, alongside gaming and watching anime with my friends. I try to utilize some of my free time to spend with my family and friends by traveling and exploring new places, as well as enjoying shopping and our favorite meals together. Beyond cybersecurity, I also enjoy delving into topics like artificial intelligence, programming, and ethical hacking, constantly seeking to broaden my knowledge and contribute to a safer digital world. </p>
